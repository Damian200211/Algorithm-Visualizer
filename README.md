# Algorithm Visualizer

A tool to visualize various algorithms, such as sorting, searching, and pathfinding, in an interactive way. This project aims to help users better understand how algorithms work through animations and step-by-step breakdowns.

## Features

- Visualize sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort)
- Visualize search algorithms (Binary Search, Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search)
- Interactive user interface to control the speed and step through each algorithm
- Customizable input data (e.g., users can enter their own arrays)
